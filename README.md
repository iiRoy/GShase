## Main Database Workflow

The system follows this basic workflow:

```text
User searches for a document
        ↓
busqueda.php queries the database
        ↓
Matching documents are displayed
        ↓
User opens a document result
        ↓
visualizacion.php loads metadata
        ↓
viewpdf.php displays the PDF BLOB
```

Admin workflow:

```text
Admin logs in
        ↓
adminPagina.php loads pending documents
        ↓
Admin validates or deletes documents
        ↓
Database is updated
```

---

## Security Notes

This project is suitable for local academic demonstration, but it should be improved before production use.

Important security concerns:

- Passwords appear to be stored without hashing.
- Database credentials are hardcoded.
- User registration backend needs further implementation.
- File upload handling should be validated and secured.
- Admin and user roles should be separated more clearly.
- External chatbot scripts should be reviewed.
- PDF BLOB output should be carefully validated.
- Session management should be hardened.
- Input sanitization should be reviewed across all forms.

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not deploy this project publicly without improving authentication, password hashing, upload validation, authorization checks, and database security.

---

## Known Issues

### Database and login field mismatch

The SQL dump defines the `usuario` table with columns such as:

```text
idUsuario
Usuario
Contrasenia
Nombre
email
```

However, `database/login.php` expects fields such as:

```text
user_name
password
name
id
```

This may cause login errors unless the database schema or PHP code is adjusted.

Recommended fix:

```text
Either update login.php to match the SQL dump, or update the SQL table column names to match login.php.
```

---

### Registration form does not fully create a user

The registration page includes frontend validation, but the form action currently points to:

```text
database/login.php
```

This means the registration page may not actually insert new user or document records into the database.

Recommended improvement:

```text
Create a dedicated database/createUser.php or database/register.php file to handle new user registration and document upload.
```

---

### Botpress depends on external scripts

The chatbot will not load if:

- There is no internet connection.
- Botpress services are unavailable.
- The configured Botpress bot is removed or disabled.

---

### PDF files are stored as database BLOBs

The project displays PDFs from the database.

This works for demonstration, but for larger production systems, it may be better to store PDF files on the server filesystem or cloud storage and save only metadata and file paths in the database.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Database connection fails

Check the configuration in:

```text
database/database.php
```

Make sure:

- MySQL/MariaDB is running.
- The database `hackaton_2024` exists.
- The username and password are correct.
- The SQL dump was imported successfully.

---

### Page shows a blank screen

Enable PHP errors during local development.

In `php.ini`, check:

```ini
display_errors = On
error_reporting = E_ALL
```

Restart Apache after editing `php.ini`.

---

### Login does not work

Check the database column mismatch described in **Known Issues**.

Also verify:

- The correct database is imported.
- The `usuario` table has valid users.
- The PHP code uses the same column names as the SQL schema.
- Sessions are enabled in PHP.

---

### Search returns no results

Check that:

- The `biblioteca` table contains records.
- The `autor` table contains matching authors.
- `biblioteca.idAutor` correctly references `autor.idAutor`.
- The search terms match document titles.
- Filters are not too restrictive.

---

### PDF preview does not load

Check that:

- The selected document exists.
- The `Documento` column contains valid PDF BLOB data.
- `database/viewpdf.php` receives a valid `id`.
- The browser supports embedded PDF preview.

---

### Chatbot does not open

Check that:

- You have internet access.
- Botpress scripts load correctly.
- The browser console does not show Botpress-related errors.
- `scripts/chatbot.js` is loaded correctly.

---

### CSS or images do not load

Make sure the project is being accessed through a local server, not opened directly as a file.

Correct:

```text
http://localhost/GShase-main/inicio.php
```

Incorrect:

```text
file:///C:/xampp/htdocs/GShase-main/inicio.php
```

---

## Possible Improvements

Future versions could include:

- Dedicated registration backend.
- Password hashing with `password_hash()`.
- Password verification with `password_verify()`.
- Cleaner role system for users, authors, institutions, and admins.
- Better login schema consistency.
- PDF upload validation.
- File-size limits.
- CSRF protection.
- More robust session management.
- Pagination for search results.
- Better responsive design.
- Search by article category or research field.
- Full-text search.
- Better document approval workflow.
- Admin audit logs.
- User profile page.
- Author profile page.
- Institution dashboard.
- Improved chatbot training and flow.
- Environment-based database configuration.
- Docker setup.
- Deployment guide.
